## Possible Research Questions

1- What are user expectations of a companion robot with continuous monitoring capabilities, which has no advanced mechanical features (similar to our robot).

4- What are potential risks and benefits of having a society which its individuals are equipped with a companion robot?

5- What are user’s expectations and concerns about a robot that follows around and monitors him/her both in terms of psychologically and physically?

6- What are potential concerns that might hinder people from using the robot?

7- How does it compare to using other devices such as wearable and how do users' expectations differ? 

8- Support animal vs. robot

9- Mediator between human and care giver. To collect the data

10- User controls, what to control, when and how to get the data.
