## Possible Research Questions

1- What are user expectations of a companion robot with continuous monitoring capabilities, which has no advanced mechanical features (similar to our robot).  

2- How do users expect the robot to communicate with them in different spaces? For instance in a semi-public space like Gym I doubt if it is feasible to use voice for communication.  

3- What are other individuals' reaction by observing a companion robot? In other words, what are their expectations? (avoiding collision, respecting their privacy,…)  

4- What are potential risks and benefits of having a society which its individuals are equipped with a companion robot?

5- What are user’s expectations and concerns about a robot that follows around and monitors him/her both in terms of psychologically and physically?

6- What are potential concerns that might hinder people from using the robot?

7- How does it compare to using other devices such as wearable and how do users' expectations differ? 

8- Support animal vs. robot... different kinds of mental health issue (anxiety, depression, etc.)
   challenges, benefits, issues.

9- Mediator between human and care giver. To collect the data and not substitute the care giver.

10- User controls, what to control, when and how to get the data.

11- Inexpensive thermal camera sensor in hospital setting and detecting the patient status in emergency setting.

12- Notification, Interupption and obtrusiveness policies should be different and not similar to smartphone and other wearables.

13- What is the impact of physical appearance and emobidification on notification.

14- depressed people wouldn't like to talk.

15- Adding on to #9, it could be very useful for someone who may have had trauma (or just shy) and doesn't feel safe to talk directly to another person about his/her problem.
