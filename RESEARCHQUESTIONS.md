## Possible Research Questions

- What are user expectations of a companion robot with continuous monitoring capabilities, which has no advanced mechanical features (similar to our robot).  

- How do users expect the robot to communicate with them in different spaces? For instance in a semi-public space like Gym I doubt if it is feasible to use voice for communication.  

- What are other individuals reaction by observing a companion robot? In other words, what are their expectations? (avoiding collision, respecting their privacy,…)  

- What are potential risks and benefits of having a society which its individuals are equipped with a companion robot?

- What are user’s expectations and concerns about a robot that follows around and monitors him/her both in terms of psychologically and physically?

- What are potential concerns that might hinder people from using the robot?

- How does it compare to using other devices such as wearable and how do users' expectations differ?
